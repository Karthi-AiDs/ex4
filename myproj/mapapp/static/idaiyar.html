    Idaiyar is a traditional term often used to refer to a person who follows or is associated with a particular region, community, or cultural group in South India. While the specific meaning of "Idaiyar" can vary depending on the context and region, it is generally a label used for certain social groups, often in Tamil Nadu, and is sometimes linked to the agricultural or pastoral communities. The term might also carry historical significance, with associations to specific customs, language, or practices within a localized area. Understanding the role of Idaiyar within the broader framework of South Indian society requires looking at the specific cultural, social, and historical nuances tied to this group.
